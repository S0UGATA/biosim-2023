class Fauna:
    """
    Super class used to represent each species on Rossum√∏ya: Herbivores and Carnivores

    Subclasses: Herbivore and Carnivore
    ...

    Attributes
    -----------
    _params: Parameters.Fauna
    A parameter which contains all the specified parameters for Fauna, imported from the module
    Parameters.py, where the type is Fauna.

    Methods
    -----------
    set_animal_parameters(cls, params: {})
    A class method that changes the default values for the animal parameters. The user can change
    any of the values, and as many as preferred, before the simulation is started.

    weight_of_baby(mean, sd)
    Method that calculates the weight of the newborn from an animal of type Herbivore or Carnivore.
    Parameters are defined beforehand, and changes depending on the Fauna (Herbivore or Carnivore).

    calculate_fitness(self):
    Method that changes the fitness for each animal, which describes the overall condition of
    the animal. The value changes each annual cycle, calculated based on age and weight using
    the formula (3) and equation values are given by formula (4).
    # TODO Add the formula in the description, or refer to it in another way

    new_animal(self, param, w_baby)
    Method that is used to create a new animal of type Herbivore or Carnivore.

    _change_weight(self, by_amount)
    Private method that calculates the new weight of an animal. The current weight either decreases
    or increases, but if a decrease results in a negative value the weight is set to 0.

    procreate(self, N: int)
    Method that decides which animals are producing an offspring. The following conditions are set:
    a) An animal can only have offspring if its weight < zeta (w_birth + sigma_birth)
    b) For each animal there is a probability for producing offspring, which is
     min(1, (gamma * fitness * N)) where N is the number of animals of the same species in the cell
     at the start of the breeding season. The gamma value is set before the simulation, either
     by user or by default, and the fitness is calculated by the method calculate_fitness(self).
     c) Each animal can give birth to at most one offspring per year.
     d) At birth, the parent loses xi times the actual birth-weight of the baby.
     e) If the parent would lose more than their own weight, no baby is born and the weight of the
     parent remains unchanged.

     get_older(self)
     Method that adds one year to the animal after an annual cycle.

     lose_weight(self)
     Method that uses the _change_weight method to decrease the weight of an animal.

     maybe_die(self)
     A boolean method that checks if an animal dies or not. Two conditions decides: if the animals
     weight is equal to zero, death definitely follows. Then there is a probability condition, set
     by the following equation: omega(1 - fitness).
