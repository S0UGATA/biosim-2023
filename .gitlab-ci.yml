# Pip's cache doesn't store the python packages

# If you want to also cache the installed packages, you have to install
# them in a virtualenv and cache it as well.

  - python -V  # Print out python version for debugging
  - pip install virtualenv
  - virtualenv venv

  - pip install flake8 tox


# NOTE:
# The "script" sections below are more complex because biolab_project is
# a subdirectory of the git repo inf200-course-materials.
# For the BioSim project, follow the single-line setup, e.g.
#
#    script:
#       - flake8 src tests
#
# from the project template.
#
# The solution here is based on
